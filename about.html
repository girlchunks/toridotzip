                <p>Victoria Köhler is a photographer and digital artist from Berlin, Germany.</p>
                <p>Instilled with a hunger for strong narratives and visual perfection by her studies and commercial work respectively, she seeks to create authentic images that resist a comfortable gaze while still satisfying aesthetically.</p>
                <p>Her intimate familiarity with queer communities, and subcultures such as the Berlin club and kink scenes add depth to her work that would be hidden to an outside observer.</p>
                <p>Victoria studied at the SRH Berlin School of Design and Communication, and has previously worked with publications and brands such as Achtung Mode, GQ, MyTheresa, Men's Health, and Saboteur. Her work has been exhibited by BLINK Berlin, and at /'fu:bar/ 2021 in Zagreb.</p>
